Function Name: Stop-GraphicalProgressBar

Inputs:
(None)

Output:
✅ No return value (void)

Algorithm:
1. If global form exists and is not disposed:
    - Close and dispose the form
2. Clear all global variables related to progress bar form and controls

Possible Issues:
✅ Must be called to free resources after progress UI is no longer needed
✅ Calling multiple times is safe (no operation after first close)
