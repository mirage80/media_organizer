Main Pipeline Orchestration Script Documentation

Description:
Coordinates the entire media processing pipeline by sequentially executing defined steps that include extraction, sanitization, metadata processing, deduplication, and more. It manages external tool validation, logging, progress tracking with a two-level GUI progress bar, and retry logic for robustness.

Input Type:
- Uses global variables and configuration paths for external tools and directories.
- $pipelineSteps array of hashtables defining each pipeline step with name, type (PowerShell/Python), path, arguments, and enabled flag.

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Runs the full pipeline, displaying progress and writing logs. May terminate early on fatal errors.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Set up environment variables, tool paths, logging levels, and import required modules.
2. Validate presence of required external tools; abort if any are missing.
3. Initialize a centralized logger function $Log.
4. Define helper functions for two-level progress bar and step retry wrapper.
5. Show the two-level progress bar GUI window.
6. Iterate through each step in $pipelineSteps:
   a. Skip disabled steps.
   b. Update overall progress bar and log step start.
   c. Run step inside Invoke-StepWithRetry to retry failed steps.
      - If step type is PowerShell, invoke it with given arguments plus current step index.
      - If step type is Python, invoke asynchronously and update lower progress bar based on Python output.
   d. On repeated failure, log error and abort pipeline.
7. After all steps or on abort, close the progress bar window and log completion.

Function Calls:
- Calls PowerShell scripts and Python scripts per pipeline step.
- Uses Invoke-StepWithRetry, Invoke-PythonScript, and progress bar update functions internally.

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Retry logic for steps with delay and logging.
✅ Covered: Real-time GUI progress updates for both overall and per-step progress.
❌ Not Covered: Parallel execution or concurrency.
❌ Not Covered: Handling unexpected pipeline state or partial failures gracefully beyond abort.
