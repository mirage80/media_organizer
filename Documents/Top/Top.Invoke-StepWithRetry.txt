Invoke-StepWithRetry Function Documentation

Description:
Executes a given scriptblock with retries on failure, logging each attempt, and delays between retries.

Input Type:
1. InvokeStep [scriptblock] — The code block representing the pipeline step to run.
2. MaxRetries [int] — Maximum number of retry attempts (default 3).
3. RetryDelaySeconds [int] — Delay in seconds between retry attempts (default 5).

Output Type:
✅ [bool] — Returns True on success; False if all retries fail.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. For each attempt from 1 to MaxRetries:
    a. Try to invoke the scriptblock.
    b. If successful, return True immediately.
    c. On failure, log a warning with attempt number and error.
    d. If more retries remain, sleep RetryDelaySeconds.
2. If all attempts fail, log an error and return False.

Function Calls:
Uses the centralized `$Log` function for logging.

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Handles exceptions and logs warnings/errors.
❌ Not Covered: No cancellation or maximum retry failure escalation.
