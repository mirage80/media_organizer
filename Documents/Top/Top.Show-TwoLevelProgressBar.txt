Show-TwoLevelProgressBar Function Documentation

Description:
Creates and shows a GUI window with two progress bars: one for overall pipeline progress and one for current step progress, along with descriptive labels.

Input Type:
1. WindowTitle [string] — Optional window title text. Defaults to "Pipeline Progress".

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Displays the two-level progress bar window.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Check if a progress form already exists and is not disposed; if so, bring it to front.
2. Otherwise, create a new Windows Forms window with fixed size, no maximize/minimize buttons, centered and always on top.
3. Create and position two progress bars and two labels for step and subtask text.
4. Add the controls to the window and display it.
5. Store references to form and controls in global variables.
6. Process UI events to keep window responsive.

Function Calls:
None

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Ensures only one instance of the progress window exists.
❌ Not Covered: No cancellation or user interaction support.
❌ Not Covered: UI may freeze if called from a non-UI thread.
