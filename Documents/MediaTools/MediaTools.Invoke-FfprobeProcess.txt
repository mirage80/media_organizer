📁 MediaTools.Invoke-FfprobeProcess Function Documentation

**Description:**  
Executes an `ffprobe` command using PowerShell, capturing the standard output lines for further processing. This low-level function powers higher-level metadata extraction operations in the module.

---

**Input Type:**  
1. `command [string]` (Mandatory) — The `ffprobe` command to execute (must include full path to the media file).  
2. `timeoutSeconds [int]` (Optional, Default: `60`) — The number of seconds to wait before timing out.

---

**Output Type:**  
✅ `[string[]]` — Array of output lines captured from `ffprobe`.  
❌ Throws `[System.Exception]` — If the process times out or fails to start.

---

**Algorithm (Pseudo-code):**  
1. Start the `ffprobe` process with the given command.  
2. Wait for the process to exit, enforcing the timeout.  
3. Read the standard output and split it into lines.  
4. Return the output lines.  
5. If the process fails or times out, throw an exception.

**Function Calls:**  
🔹 None (leaf-level process wrapper)

**Possible Issues:**  
✅ Covered: Timeout support prevents hanging on broken video files.  
✅ Covered: Captures stdout cleanly for downstream parsing.  
❌ Not Covered: No stderr capture or parsing.  
❌ Not Covered: Assumes `ffprobe` binary is available in the environment path.
