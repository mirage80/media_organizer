ðŸ”„ MediaTools.Update_FileMetadata Function Documentation

Description:
A high-level workflow function that finds the best available timestamp and geotag for a file and writes them back to the file's metadata.

Input Type:
1. File [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) â€” The media file to update.
2. TimeoutSeconds [int] (Optional, Default: 60) â€” The timeout to pass down to all underlying find and write functions.

Output Type:
âœ… [void] â€” This function does not return a value. It logs its progress and any non-critical errors.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Call `Merge_FileMetadata` to efficiently find the best available timestamp and geotag in a single pass.
2. If a consolidated timestamp was found, call `Set-Timestamp` to write it to the file.
3. If a consolidated geotag was found, call `Set-Geotag` to write it to the file.
4. Each write operation is wrapped in a `try/catch` block to log warnings on failure without halting the entire process.

Function Calls:
ðŸ”¹ Merge_FileMetadata
ðŸ”¹ Set-Timestamp
ðŸ”¹ Set-Geotag

Possible Issues:
* âœ… Covered: Highly efficient by calling `Merge_FileMetadata` only once.
* âœ… Covered: Gracefully handles cases where only a timestamp, only a geotag, or neither is found to write.
* âœ… Covered: Logs individual write failures as warnings without stopping the process.
