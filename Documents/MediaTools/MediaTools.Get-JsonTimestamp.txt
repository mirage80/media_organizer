🕒 MediaTools.Get-JsonTimestamp Function Documentation

Description:
Extracts and standardizes the best available timestamp from a Google Photos `.json` sidecar file. It prioritizes the `photoTakenTime` field and falls back to `creationTime`.

Input Type:

1. JsonFile [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) — The `.json` sidecar file to process.

Output Type:
✅ [string] — The standardized timestamp string.
❌ Throws [System.FormatException] — If no valid timestamp can be found in the JSON file.

Algorithm:
1. Read and parse the input `JsonFile`.
2. Pass the `photoTakenTime.formatted` and `creationTime.formatted` values to `Format-Timestamp`.
3. Check if the standardized `photoTakenDate` is valid using `Test-Timestamp`. If it is, return it.
4. If not, check if the standardized `creationDate` is valid. If it is, return it.
5. If neither timestamp is valid, throw a `FormatException`.

Function Calls:
🔹 Format-Timestamp
🔹 Test-Timestamp

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Covered: Prioritizes the more accurate `photoTakenTime` over `creationTime`.
* ✅ Covered: Gracefully handles missing or null timestamp fields.
* ✅ Covered: Ensures all output is in the module's canonical format by using `Format-Timestamp`.
* ✅ Covered: Fails fast by throwing an exception if no valid timestamp can be found.
