📁 MediaTools.Clear-MediaToolsCache Function Documentation

Description:
Clears internal module-wide caches, including the global FieldMap and the logger instance. This is typically called during initialization or before reloading module configurations.

Input Type:
❌ None

Output Type:
✅ [void] — This function does not return any output.
❌ Throws only in exceptional cases (e.g., global variable uninitialized).

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Clear the global `$FieldMap` cache if it exists.
2. Reset the `$script:MediaToolsLogger` to its default no-op state.
3. Used before resetting logging or field metadata structures.

Function Calls:
❌ None

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Covered: Ensures logger and field map are cleanly reset.
* ✅ Covered: Safe to call multiple times; idempotent.
* ❌ Not Covered: If called mid-process, consumers depending on previous cache may break without reinitialization.
