üñºÔ∏è MediaTools.Test-IsPhoto Function Documentation


Description:
Checks if a given file is a photo by comparing its extension against a predefined, module-level list of common image formats.

Input Fields:
1. file [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The file object to check.

Output Type:
‚úÖ [bool] ‚Äî Returns `$true` if the file's extension is a known photo format, otherwise `$false`.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Get the file's extension from the input file object.
2. Convert the extension to lowercase to ensure a reliable, case-insensitive comparison.
3. Check if the lowercase extension exists in the module-level `$script:imageExtensions` list.
4. Return the boolean result of the check.

Function Calls:
None.

Possible Issues:
* ‚úÖ Covered: The check is case-insensitive (e.g., ".JPG", ".JPEG" are handled correctly).
* ‚úÖ Covered: Relies on a centralized, module-level list of extensions (`$script:imageExtensions`) for easy maintenance.
* ‚ùå Not Covered: The function only checks the extension. It does not validate the file's content (e.g., using magic bytes). A file renamed to `.jpg` that is not an image will still be identified as a photo.
