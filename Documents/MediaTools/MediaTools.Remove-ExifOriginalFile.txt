üóëÔ∏è MediaTools.Remove-ExifOriginalFile Function Documentation

Description:
Recursively finds and deletes backup files created by tools like ExifTool. It specifically targets any file whose extension ends with `_original` (e.g., `photo.jpg_original`).

Input Type:
1. root [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The root directory to search within.

Output Type:
‚úÖ [int] ‚Äî The number of files successfully deleted.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Accept a mandatory directory path `$root`.
2. Initialize a `deletedCount` to 0.
3. Recursively search for all files within `$root` where the extension is like `*_original`.
4. For each file found:
   a. Attempt to delete the file inside a `try/catch` block.
   b. On success, log an INFO message and increment `deletedCount`.
   c. On failure (e.g., permission denied), log a WARNING with the error message and continue.
5. Return the final `deletedCount`.

Possible Issues:
* ‚úÖ Covered: The function no longer fails silently. Deletion errors (e.g., file in use, permissions) are caught and logged as warnings.
* ‚úÖ Covered: Provides feedback by logging each successful deletion and returning a total count.
* ‚ùå Not Covered: The function does not check for or delete any associated sidecar files (e.g., a `.json` file that might have been created for the `_original` file).
