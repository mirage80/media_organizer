Function:
MediaTools.Get_Exif_Timestamp

Description:
Extracts and returns the most relevant timestamp from Exif metadata, prioritizing DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate, or MediaCreateDate, and formats it into a standardized string.

Input Type:

1. ExifData [PSCustomObject] — Parsed JSON metadata object from ExifTool (e.g., from Get-ExifDataAsJson)

Output Type:
✅ [string] — Timestamp in format "yyyy:MM:dd HH:mm:ss+00:00"
❌ Returns $null if no valid timestamp is found or if parsing fails

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):

1. Check for existence of any relevant timestamp field
1.1 Look for DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate, MediaCreateDate (in order of priority)
1.2 If none are found → return $null

2. Extract the timestamp string from the first available field

3. Call MediaTools.Standardize_TimeStamp to normalize the format
— Purpose: Reformat timestamp to "yyyy:MM:dd HH:mm:ss+00:00" with UTC offset

4. Return the standardized timestamp string

Possible Issues:

* ✅ Covered: Missing all relevant timestamp fields
* ✅ Covered: Standardization of various timestamp formats handled by Standardize_TimeStamp
* ❌ Not Covered: Invalid timestamp formats not recognized by Standardize_TimeStamp
* ❌ Not Covered: Ambiguous timezones in ExifTool values (e.g., no offset)
* ❌ Not Covered: Future dates or invalid dates not explicitly validated
