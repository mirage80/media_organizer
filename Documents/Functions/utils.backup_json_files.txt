🧰 Function: utils.backup_json_files

Description:
Creates timestamped backup copies of one or more JSON files by duplicating them into a backup/ subdirectory.

Input Type:
1. file_paths [list[str]] — List of full paths to .json files to back up
2. logger [Logger] — Logger instance for status and error reporting

Output Type:
✅ [None] — Successfully completes the backup operation
❌ Logs warnings or errors on failure; does not raise exceptions

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Get current timestamp string → format as "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
2. For each file path in file_paths:
   2.1 Check if file exists
   2.2 If it does not exist:
       🔸 Call logger.warning()
       → Skip to next file
   2.3 Create backup/ subdirectory in same directory as file (if not already there)
   2.4 Construct destination backup path:
       → original_filename.backup_TIMESTAMP.json
   2.5 Copy original file to backup location
   2.6 🔸 Call logger.info() on success
   2.7 On exception:
       🔸 Call logger.warning() and continue

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Source file missing
✅ Covered: Destination backup folder does not exist
✅ Covered: Exception during file copy
✅ Covered: Non-JSON file paths are skipped
❌ Not Covered: Files with restricted permissions
❌ Not Covered: Name collisions from repeated backups at same timestamp (unlikely)
