üìÅ Move-MediaFileByMetadata Function Documentation

Description:  
Moves a single media file to a categorized subfolder within a target directory while preserving its original relative path. The category is determined by the presence of valid timestamp and geotag metadata.

Input Type:  
1. filePath [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The source file to move.  
2. rootDir [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The original root directory of the source file, used to calculate the relative path.  
3. targetPath [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The root of the destination where the categorized folders will be created.  
4. TimeoutSeconds [int] (Optional, Default: 60) ‚Äî The timeout to pass down to the underlying metadata-fetching functions.

Output Type:  
‚úÖ [string] ‚Äî The category name the file was moved to (e.g., "with_time_with_geo").  
‚ùå Throws an exception if the underlying Move_FileToDestination call fails.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):  
1. Call Get-MediaFileCategory to determine the file's category.  
2. Construct the new destination root path by joining the targetPath with the category.  
3. Call Move_FileToDestination, passing the source file, original root directory, and the new destination root directory.  
4. If successful, log the move and return the category name.

Function Calls:  
üîπ Get-MediaFileCategory  
üîπ Move_FileToDestination

Possible Issues:  
‚úÖ Covered: Delegates all file system operations to the robust Move_FileToDestination helper function.  
‚úÖ Covered: Correctly preserves the original directory structure under the new categorized root.  
‚ùå Not Covered: The function itself does not perform error handling; it relies on the caller to catch exceptions thrown by Move_FileToDestination.
