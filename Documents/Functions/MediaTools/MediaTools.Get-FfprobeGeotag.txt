📹 MediaTools.Get-FfprobeGeotag Function Documentation

Description:
Extracts the location tag (typically in ISO 6709 format) from a media file's ffprobe metadata and returns it as a standardized 4-part geotag string.

Input Type:
1. File [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) — The media file to process.
2. TimeoutSeconds [int] (Optional, Default: 60) — The timeout to pass down to the underlying ffprobe process.

Output Type:
✅ [string] — The standardized 4-part geotag string.
❌ Returns `$null` if no location tag is found.
❌ Throws an exception if the found location string is invalid and cannot be standardized.

Algorithm:
1. Call `Get-FfprobeData` to get the cached or fresh metadata for the file.
2. If no metadata is returned, return `$null`.
3. Access the location tag from the metadata (checking both `com.apple.quicktime.location.ISO6709` and `location`).
4. If the tag exists, pass its value directly to `Format-GeoTag` and return the result.
5. If the tag does not exist, return `$null`.

Function Calls:
🔹 Get-FfprobeData
🔹 Format-GeoTag

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Covered: Leverages the high-performance caching of `Get-FfprobeData`.
* ✅ Covered: Ensures all output is in the module's canonical format by delegating parsing to `Format-GeoTag`.
* ❌ Not Covered: This function specifically targets the `location` and `com.apple.quicktime.location.ISO6709` tags and will not find geotags stored in other ffprobe metadata tags.
