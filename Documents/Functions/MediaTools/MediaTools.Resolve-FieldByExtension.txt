📁 MediaTools.Resolve-FieldByExtension Function Documentation

**Description:**  
Returns a hashtable of expected metadata fields (e.g., timestamp, geotag) based on the file’s extension. Used to decide which fields should be parsed or written for different media types such as images or videos.

---

**Input Type:**  
1. `ext [string]` — The lowercase file extension (e.g., "jpg", "mp4").

---

**Output Type:**  
✅ [hashtable] — The field mapping for the given extension.  
❌ Returns a default field set if the extension is unknown or missing from the map.

---

**Algorithm (Pseudo-code):**  
1. Check if `$global:FieldMap` contains an entry for `ext`.  
2. If yes, return the associated field list (as a hashtable).  
3. If no, return a default fallback field set.

---

**Function Calls:**  
🔹 None directly (relies on `$global:FieldMap` variable)

---

**Possible Issues:**  
✅ Covered: Handles unknown extensions by returning defaults.  
✅ Covered: Function is non-breaking—never throws.  
❌ Not Covered: Depends on correct external initialization of `$global:FieldMap`.  
❌ Not Covered: Does not validate structure or types of `$FieldMap` values.
