üß≠ MediaTools.Convert-GeoTagToDecimal Function Documentation

Description:
Parses a Degrees-Minutes-Seconds (DMS) coordinate string into a signed decimal degree value. This is a strict helper function designed to handle a specific format.

Input Type:
1. DmsString [string] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The coordinate string in a DMS format (e.g., `40 deg 5' 15.5"`).
2. CardinalDirection [string] (Mandatory) ‚Äî The direction ("N", "S", "E", or "W") used to apply the correct sign to the decimal value.

Output Type:
‚úÖ [double] ‚Äî The calculated signed decimal degree value.
‚ùå Throws [System.FormatException] ‚Äî If the input string is not in a recognized DMS format or if its components cannot be converted to numbers.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Match the input `DmsString` against a flexible regex that looks for degrees, minutes, and seconds parts.
2. If it doesn't match, log an error and throw a `FormatException`.
3. If it matches, attempt to convert the captured degree, minute, and second parts to `[double]`.
4. If conversion fails, log an error and throw a `FormatException`.
5. Calculate the decimal value: `degrees + (minutes / 60) + (seconds / 3600)`.
6. If `CardinalDirection` is "S" or "W", multiply the decimal value by -1.
7. Return the final signed decimal value.

Possible Issues:
* ‚úÖ Covered: The regex is flexible enough to handle common DMS variations, including `deg`, `¬∞`, and malformed quote characters.
* ‚úÖ Covered: Fails fast by throwing a specific `FormatException` on any parsing or conversion error, preventing bad data from propagating.
* ‚úÖ Covered: Correctly applies a negative sign for "S" and "W" directions.
* ‚ùå Not Covered: The function is highly specialized for DMS format and will not parse other formats like pure decimal degrees.
