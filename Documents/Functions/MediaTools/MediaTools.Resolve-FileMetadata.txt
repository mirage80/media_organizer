📁 MediaTools.Resolve-FileMetadata Function Documentation

Description:  
Orchestrates the process of finding the best available timestamp and geotag for a file by calling the high-level `Find_ValidTimestamp` and `Find-ValidGeotag` functions.

Input Type:  
1. File [System.IO.FileInfo] (Mandatory) — The media file to process.  

Output Type:  
✅ [PSCustomObject] — A custom object with two properties:  
    • ConsolidatedTimestamp: The best timestamp found, or `$null`.  
    • ConsolidatedGeotag: The best geotag found, or `$null`.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):  
1. Call `Find_ValidTimestamp` for the file inside a `try/catch` block.  
    - If it succeeds, store the result.  
    - If it fails, store `$null` and log a warning.  
2. Call `Find-ValidGeotag` for the file inside a `try/catch` block.  
    - If it succeeds, store the result.  
    - If it fails, store `$null` and log a warning.  
3. Return a `PSCustomObject` containing the timestamp and geotag.

Function Calls:  
🔹 Find_ValidTimestamp  
🔹 Find-ValidGeotag

Possible Issues:  
* ✅ Covered: Gracefully handles failures from the underlying `Find-*` functions by catching exceptions and returning `$null`.  
* ✅ Covered: Reuses validated logic from `Find_ValidTimestamp` and `Find-ValidGeotag`.  
* ❌ Not Covered: This function does not perform its own validation—relies entirely on upstream logic.
