📁 MediaTools.Flush-MediaToolsCache Function Documentation

Description:
Reinitializes all MediaTools caches and logger by first clearing existing state, then resetting the logger configuration. Used during module reload or when changing log destinations.

Input Type:
❌ None

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Does not return any output.
❌ Throws only in rare cases like uninitialized global state.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Call `Clear-MediaToolsCache` to wipe all global field maps and logger.
2. Call `Set-MediaToolsLogger` to reconfigure logging with current module state.
3. Use as part of a full metadata pipeline reset or to flush stale configurations.

Function Calls:
✅ `Clear-MediaToolsCache`  
✅ `Set-MediaToolsLogger`

Possible Issues:
✅ Logger instance reset may cause reinitialization conflicts if called during active operations  
✅ Safe when called during startup or explicit reset  
❌ Not Covered: No lock guarantees if shared across threads
