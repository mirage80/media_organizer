üß≠ MediaTools.Resolve-DirectionString Function Documentation

Description:
Replaces various direction formats (e.g., "North", "n", "south") within a string with their standardized single-character uppercase equivalent ("N", "S", etc.). This is useful for sanitizing geotag components.

Input Type:
1. inputString [string] ‚Äî The string containing direction words or letters to normalize.

Output Type:
‚úÖ [string] ‚Äî The string with all direction indicators replaced by their standard single-character form. Returns the original string if it's null or empty.
‚ùå Returns original string if no matches are found

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. If the input string is null or empty, return it immediately.
2. Use a single, case-insensitive regular expression to find all occurrences of "north", "n", "south", "s", etc., that are whole words.
3. For each match found, use a "Match Evaluator" script block to take the first character of the match (e.g., the 'n' from "north") and convert it to uppercase.
4. Return the fully replaced string in a single pass.

Function Calls:
None.

Possible Issues:
* ‚úÖ Covered: The use of word boundaries (`\b`) correctly prevents the function from altering words that contain directions (e.g., "northern" or "southbound").
* ‚úÖ Covered: The process is case-insensitive ("North", "north", and "n" are all treated the same).
* ‚úÖ Covered: The implementation is highly efficient, performing all replacements in a single pass over the string.
