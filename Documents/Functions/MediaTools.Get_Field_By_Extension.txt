Function:
MediaTools.Get_Field_By_Extension

Description:
Retrieves the list of metadata fields associated with a given file extension by looking up a predefined mapping.

Input Type:
1. extension [string] — The file extension (e.g., .jpg, .mp4) to look up.
2. mapping_table [hashtable] — A dictionary mapping extensions to lists of metadata fields.

Output Type:
✅ [string[]] — An array of metadata field names for the extension (may be empty).
❌ Returns @() (empty array) if the extension is not found or input is invalid.

Algorithm:
1. Normalize extension input
   1.1. Convert extension to lowercase
   1.2. If it does not start with ".", prepend a dot
2. Look up in mapping
   2.1. Check if normalized extension exists in mapping_table
   2.2. If found → return associated list of fields
   2.3. Else → return empty array @()

Function Calls:
* No sub-functions are explicitly called within this function.

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Covered: Handles missing . in extensions
* ✅ Covered: Returns empty array if mapping does not contain the extension
* ❌ Not Covered: No validation for malformed mapping_table
												  
* ❌ Not Covered: No validation for null or empty extension
* ✅ Covered: Case-insensitive matching via .ToLower()
