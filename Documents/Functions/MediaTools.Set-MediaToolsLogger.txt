Function:
Mediatools.Set-MediaToolsLogger

Description:
Sets the shared logger object used across all MediaTools module functions for structured logging.

Input Type:

1. logger [object] — A logger instance (usually a [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject]) containing at least a Write-Log method.

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Sets a module-wide logger variable.
❌ Throws runtime error if logger is not supplied or does not contain Write-Log.

Algorithm:

1. Validate logger input
   1.1. Check if logger is $null → throw error
   1.2. Check if logger contains method Write-Log → if not, throw error
2. Set module variable
   2.1. Assign logger to internal module-wide variable $MediaToolsLogger

Function Calls:

* None directly, but expects the logger object to include:
  * Write-Log → for downstream logging functionality

Possible Issues:

* ✅ Covered: Fails early if logger is null
* ✅ Covered: Fails if logger doesn't have required method
* ❌ Not Covered: No fallback logger is created internally
* ❌ Not Covered: No test for whether Write-Log is callable (assumes correct structure)
* ✅ Covered: Sets logger only once explicitly with the provided object
