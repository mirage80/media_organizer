Function Name:
MediaTools.Remove_FilesWithOriginalExtension

Description:
Removes media files that still retain their original extension (e.g., .mov, .heic) after conversion.

Input Fields:
1. file_list [list] — List of file paths to examine
2. original_exts [list] — List of original extensions to remove (e.g., [".mov", ".heic"])
3. logger [Logger] — Logger object to record deletions

Output Type:
✅ [int] — Number of files successfully removed
❌ Returns 0 if none are removed

Algorithm:
1. Initialize counter to 0
2. For each file in file_list:
  2.1 Check if file extension matches any in original_exts
  2.2 If match:
    2.2.1 Attempt to delete file
    2.2.2 Log success or failure
    2.2.3 Increment counter on success
3. Return total deletions

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Handles case-insensitive extensions
* ✅ Logs each deletion event
* ❌ No retry mechanism on deletion failure
* ❌ Silent skip if permission denied or file in use
* ❌ No check for sidecar files (.json, .xmp)
