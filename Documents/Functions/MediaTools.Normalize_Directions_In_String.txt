Function:
MediaTools.Normalize_Directions_In_String

Description:
Replaces full cardinal directions ("North", "South", "East", "West") in a string with their standardized abbreviations ("N", "S", "E", "W").

Input Type:
1. inputString [string]

Output Type:
✅ [string] — same string with normalized cardinal directions
❌ Returns original string if no matches are found

Algorithm:
1. If input is null or empty
   1.1 Return input as-is
2. Replace cardinal direction words (case-insensitive)
   2.1 Replace "North" → "N"
   2.2 Replace "South" → "S"
   2.3 Replace "East" → "E"
   2.4 Replace "West" → "W"
3. Return the modified string

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Replaces all four cardinal directions
✅ Covered: Case-insensitive match using -replace operator
❌ Not Covered: Does not handle malformed strings (e.g. "northbound", "eastern")
❌ Not Covered: No trimming of extra whitespace or punctuation
❌ Not Covered: Does not verify if replacements result in a valid geotag format
