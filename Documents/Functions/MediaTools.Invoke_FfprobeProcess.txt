Function Name:
MediaTools.Invoke-FfprobeProcess

Description:
Runs the ffprobe command on a video file and captures its output as JSON.

Input Fields:
1. file_path [string] — Path to the video file
2. ffprobe_path [string] — Path to the ffprobe binary

Output Type:
✅ [dict] — Parsed ffprobe metadata as dictionary
❌ Returns None if execution fails or output is malformed

Algorithm:
1. Build command
  1.1 Create a subprocess command with ffprobe_path and file_path
  1.2 Set format to JSON and suppress unnecessary output
2. Execute command
  2.1 Run subprocess and capture stdout and stderr
3. Parse result
  3.1 Decode stdout as UTF-8
  3.2 Parse JSON output
  3.3 Return parsed dictionary
  3.4 On failure, return None

Possible Issues:
* ✅ Handles common ffprobe output
* ✅ Minimal and efficient JSON parsing
* ❌ No timeout enforcement
* ❌ ffprobe path or permissions may cause silent failure
* ❌ Assumes ffprobe is available and functional
