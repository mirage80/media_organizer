Stop-GraphicalProgressBar Function Documentation

Description:
Closes and disposes of the global graphical progress bar form, releasing its resources. Ensures that global variables tracking the form and progress bar are removed.

Input Type:
None

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Closes the graphical progress bar window and cleans up resources.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Check if the global progress form variable exists and is not disposed.  
2. If so, call Close() and Dispose() on the form to release resources.  
3. If an exception occurs during closing, issue a warning with the error message.  
4. In all cases, remove the global variables for the form and progress bar to clean up.

Function Calls:
None

Possible Issues:
✅ Covered: Gracefully handles exceptions during close without stopping the caller.  
✅ Covered: Ensures global variables are removed to prevent stale references.  
❌ Not Covered: Does not check if the form was ever created before.  
❌ Not Covered: Does not handle re-creation of the progress bar.
