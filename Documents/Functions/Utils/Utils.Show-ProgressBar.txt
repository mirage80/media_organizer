Show-ProgressBar Function Documentation

Description:
Displays a graphical progress bar window using Windows Forms. The progress bar updates according to the current and total values and displays an optional message.

Input Type:
1. Current [int] — The current progress step.  
2. Total [int] — The total number of steps.  
3. Message [string] — An optional status message to display in the progress window.

Output Type:
✅ [void] — Updates the graphical progress bar window.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):
1. Ensure the System.Windows.Forms assembly is loaded.  
2. If the global progress form does not exist or is disposed, create a new Form with fixed size, no control box, and topmost property set.  
3. Create a ProgressBar control inside the form with appropriate size and location.  
4. Update the ProgressBar maximum to Total and value to Current.  
5. Set the window title and message label text to include Current, Total, and the Message.  
6. Show the form and refresh it to update the display.  
7. Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid breaking the caller.
