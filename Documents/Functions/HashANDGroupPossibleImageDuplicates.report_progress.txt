Function:
HashANDGroupPossibleImageDuplicates.report_progress

Description:
Renders a dynamic ASCII progress bar in the console to indicate task progress during image deduplication.

Input Type:

1. current [int] — The current progress count.
2. total [int] — The total count corresponding to 100% completion.
3. prefix [string] — A label prefixing the progress output.
4. bar_length [int] — The width (in characters) of the progress bar.

Output Type:
✅ [None] — Progress bar is printed to standard output.
❌ No value is returned. No exceptions are explicitly raised.

Algorithm (Pseudo-code):

1. Normalize current progress
   1.1. If total is 0 → set percent = 1.0 to avoid division error
   1.2. Else → percent = current / total
2. Calculate visual progress
   2.1. Compute filled_length = int(bar_length * percent)
   2.2. Generate string of filled_length "=" characters + remaining "-" characters
3. Compose status string
   3.1. Format as prefix |progress bar| XX.XX%
4. Render to console
   4.1. Use sys.stdout.write() and sys.stdout.flush() for inline updates

Function Calls:

* Calls sys.stdout.write() to overwrite previous line in terminal.
* Calls sys.stdout.flush() to ensure immediate rendering.

Possible Issues:

* ✅ Covered: Handles 0 as total by defaulting percent to 100%
* ✅ Covered: Progress over 100% does not raise errors
* ❌ Not Covered: No validation for bar_length < 1
* ✅ Covered: Accepts any prefix string without restriction
* ❌ Not Covered: Not designed for non-interactive environments (e.g., logs or GUI)
